# Py-AutoTyper
PyAutoType that autotypes texts onto formats like .dxt.

This doesn't simulate keypresses so it might not work where simulation is needed.
This just write all the text that is in the .txt file onto any program where typing is needed.

Dependencies:
 - keyboard
    ```pip install keyboard```


```
$ Input the .txt file location
$ Press F6 Hotkey to begin in 3 seconds
